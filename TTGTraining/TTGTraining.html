        <p><strong>1. Introduction on TTG interface:</strong></p>
        <p>
            The task is to group relevant tweets on certain topics into semantic clusters using your own judgment, and here's a web interface that you can interact
            with in order to create such groups, open:
            <a href="http://ylwang99.github.io/TweetTimelineGeneration/annotation-twitterstyle.html">
            http://ylwang99.github.io/TweetTimelineGeneration/annotation-twitterstyle.html
            </a>
            , below is step-by-step instructions on how to manipulate it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2. Step-by-step demo (take topic 33 as an example)</strong></p>
        <p>
            (1) Click on "Instructions" to get a basic instruction on how to manipulate the interface. During the whole process, you can press Space to create a new cluster, press 'x' or
            'X' to take suggestion, press 'z' or 'Z' to undo.

            (2) Select topic 33. Whenever working on a new topic, search it online to get some background information about it. For example, a page link
            <a href="http://www.cesarsway.com/training/thewalk/6-Tips-for-Mastering-the-Dog-Walk">
                http://www.cesarsway.com/training/thewalk/6-Tips-for-Mastering-the-Dog-Walk
            </a>
            might be helpful with this topic.

            (3) New tweet comes one at a time at the bottom and the number of remaining tweets is displayed on the upper right. For a tweet, you can decide whether to
            make it a new cluster or put it in an existing cluster, and next tweet would automatically come up once a decision has been made.
            <br/><img src="images/3.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            (3.1) For the first tweet, just make it a new cluster by pressing Space. Each white bar here is a cluster of semantically similar tweets.
            <br/><img src="images/4.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            (3.2) For the second tweet,
            <br/><img src="images/5.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            since it doesn't share same content with the existing clusters(the first tweet), also make it a new cluster by pressing Space.
            <br/><img src="images/6.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            (3.3)For the third tweet,
            <br/><img src="images/7.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            because it's semantically similar with the second cluster, put it in the second cluster by clicking "Add" button in front of the
            second cluster and it will be automatically collapsed into the second cluster.
            <br/><img src="images/8.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            (3.4) Here you can click on "Expand all" or "Collapse all" to expand/collapse all the existing clusters.
            <br/>
            (3.5) Fourth tweet, again, add it to the second cluster.
            <br/>
            (3.6) Fifth tweet is highlighted with light blue color, which means system finds an existing cluster(which is also highlighted with light blue color) that is
            similar, you can press 'x' to take the suggestion or follow any judgment that you feel is correct and make the annotation. Note that suggestion doesn't
            always happen and you need to rely on your own judgment to make annotation most of the time.
            <br/><img src="images/9.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            (3.7) If you're regretting on any annotations and want to undo previous operations, just press 'z'.
            <br/>
            (3.8) Keep annotating the tweets till you're done, like below:
            <br/><img src="images/10.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            (3.9) Click on "Store results" on the upper right, and a file window will pop up for you to store the clustering results.
            <br/><img src="images/11.png" width=1000px/><br/>
            The file name has been given, so you can just choose a place to store it. The annotation on this topic is done once the file has been successfully created and stored.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Exercise and annotation</strong></p>
        <p>
            (1) Work on topic 33 yourself to get familiar with the interface.
            <br/>
            (2) Once you're done with the training, you'll be given 10 topics to annotate on your own laptops anywhere in a week. When finished, email the results
            back, come back to CLIP for $150 compensation, and if interested, work on another batch of topics.
